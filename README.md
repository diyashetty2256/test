# 🚀 Space Travel Weather Station

Ever wanted to check the weather like you're commanding a spaceship? Welcome to your personal weather station with a cosmic twist!

## What Does This Do?

This is a simple, fun weather app that tells you what the weather is like anywhere in the world. Just type in a city name and boom—you get the temperature, how it actually feels, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure. All wrapped up in a cool space-themed design with twinkling stars and neon vibes.

## Features

✨ **Search Any City** - Type a city name and see its weather instantly  
🌟 **Starfield Background** - Animated stars twinkling in the background  
💫 **Glowing Design** - Futuristic neon cyan styling that looks awesome  
📊 **Weather Details** - Temperature, feels-like temp, humidity, wind, and pressure  
🎯 **Super Simple** - No complicated setup, just open and use  

## How to Use It

1. Download or clone this project
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Type a city name (like "New York", "Tokyo", "Paris")
4. Click Search or press Enter
5. Watch the weather data appear in your space command center!

**Tip:** London's weather loads by default when you first open it.

## The Files

```
index.html  → The main page (HTML structure)
style.css   → All the cool space styling
script.js   → The magic that makes it work
README.md   → This file!
```

## How It Actually Works

The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** (it's free!) to grab real weather data from the internet. When you search for a city:

1. Your search gets sent to OpenWeatherMap
2. They send back the actual weather data
3. We display it in a fun space-themed layout
4. You see the weather instantly!

## What You Need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge—any of them work)
- An internet connection (to fetch real weather data)
- That's it! No installation needed.

## Want to Improve It?

Here are some cool ideas you could add:

- A 5-day weather forecast
- Use your phone's location to show local weather
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Save your favorite cities
- Weather alerts when storms are coming

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't find the city"** → Make sure you spelled it right and try again  
**"Nothing shows up"** → Check your internet connection  
**"Looks broken"** → Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache  

## Just For Fun

Made with ❤️ and a love for space. No fancy frameworks, just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript doing their thing. Perfect for learning how web apps work!
